									<p>You ever wary of what you're ordering online, so you decide to rely on the reviews and details in order to see if it'll be worth it? Well... I don't recommend doing that with people, but what I WILL say is that this made for a very entertaining exercise. So without further ado, here are some Amanda reviews!</p>
										<hr />
									<p>If I were to order Amanda online, my search bar would consist of:</p>
										<ul>
											<li>Hardworking- literally the most hard working person I know</li>
											<li>Shrek Loving- specifically "Shrek is Love, Shrek is Life" on YouTube... however I don't recommend watching it.</li>
											<li>Artistic- if anyone's ever going to do art, it's gonna be her! She's so good & creative!</li>
										</ul>	
									<p> She's truly one of a kind! Like a four leaf clover that somehow sprouted a flower </p>	
										<hr />
									<p>Are you looking for a driven, tenacious, charismatic, kind, and amazing person? Then you're in luck! Amanda Hurst is just that and more! With an Amanda in your life, you'll notice the significant impact she'll have on your day to day life. She'll make sure all of your wildest dreams come true! Even the most out-of-the-box idea, she'll find a way to make it happen! Amanda won't let anything, I mean ANYTHING, get in her way. All in all, Amanda Hurst is a person that you don't see every day. All those who are lucky enough to work with her will see the impact she has. She makes sure no one is left behind-- not leading with the mindset for personal glory, but rather with the intent to benefit all of her people. She is real-life Leslie Knope. For those reasons and many MANY more, you'd definitely want to have an Amanda Hurst in your life. It's a decision you won't regret :) </p>
